##Conditional Design Workbook

>Through the influence of the media and technology on our world, our lives are increasingly characterized by speed and constant change. We live in a dynamic, data-driven society that is continually sparking new forms of human interaction and social contexts. Instead of romanticizing the past, we want to adapt our way of working to coincide with these developments, and we want our work to reflect the here and now. We want to embrace the complexity of this landscape, deliver insight into it and show both its beauty and its shortcomings.
>Our work focuses on processes rather than products: things that adapt to their environment, emphasize change and show difference.

>Instead of operating under the terms of Graphic Design, Interaction Design, Media Art or Sound Design, we want to introduce Conditional Design as a term that refers to our approach rather than our chosen media. We conduct our activities using the methods of philosophers, engineers, inventors and mystics.

> Beaches are ordered without being controlled. No one is in charge. [...] Underlying the beach's appeal is a simple idea : the beach is a commons where peopke can self-organise in play [...] There are no zoning regulations, fences nor white lines to tell you where to go.

> [...] In thi work, Abramovic reels off all the words she can possibly remember. By reciting all the words stored in her memory, she tries to free herself from the acquired language. After an hour and a half, she seems to have suceeded.
