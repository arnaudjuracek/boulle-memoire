#Karl Gerstner, **'Designing Programmes'**

##Résumé
> Karl Gerstner’s work is a milestone in the history of design. One of his most important works is Designing Programmes, which is presented here in a new edition of the original 1964 publication. In four essays, the author provides a basic introduction to his design methodology. Instead of set recipes, the method suggests a model for design in the early days of the computer era.
> The intellectual models it proposes, however, continue to be useful today. What it does not purvey is cut-and-dried, true-or-false solutions or absolutes of any kind - instead, it develops fundamental principles in an innovative and future-oriented way. The book is especially topical and exciting in the context of current developments in computational design, which seem to hold out the possibility of programmed design. With many examples from the worlds of graphic and product design, music, architecture, and art, it inspires the reader to seize on the material, develop it further, and integrate it into his or her own work.

##Programme as Logic
> **To describe the problem is part of the solution**. This implies : not to make creative decisions as prompted by feeling but by intellectual criteria. The more exact and complete these criteria are, the more creative the work becomes. The creative process is to be reduced to an act of selection. Designing means : to pick out determining elements and combine them. Seen in these terms, designing calls for method.

> The criteria are rough. As the work proceeds, of course, they are to be made into parameters and new components are to be specified, etc. Moreover, they are not only rough, they are also not self-contained. The component "something else" is the parcel in which the left-overs are packed if the parameter does not break down neatly. The designations are imprecise in some cases. There are many imperfections. **But it is precisely in drawing up the scheme, in striving for perfection, that the work really lies**. The work is not diminished; it is merely transferred to another plane.

##About a gothic cathedral
> [...] Joyful, because it gave theme pleasure to create complicated patterns in profusion. Artful, because they tempered the complicacy to the beholder and concealed the profusion. That is : none of the 16 windows [...] is identical with another; simply because somebody wanted *to have fun* (a whim, perhaps, of the head artisan ?) Each window is a design in itself based on an exact programme of constants and variants.

##Integral Typography
> Typography is an art not in spite of its serving a purpose but for that very reason. The designer's freedom lies not at the margin of a task but at its very centre. Only then is the typographer free to perform as an artist when he understands and ponders his task in all its parts. And every solution he finds on this basis will be an integral one, will achieve a unity between language and type, between content and form.
> Integral means: shaped into a whole. There the Aristotelian dictum that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts is assumed. And this vitally concerns typography. Typography is the art of making a whole out of predeterminated parts. The typographer "sets". He sets individual letters into words, words into sentences.

##Computing Typography
> [...] And now names for industrial products are found by means of electronic computers. This happens as follows: somme three random vowels and four consonants are fed into the computer which registers in a few moments thousands of combinations, **replacing imagination by mechanical choice**. These meaningless word-creations have become indispensable to publicity. The label departments of every firm of importance have dozens of them in stock; before the products exist the name is already registered and protected by law.
> Lissitzky, addressing the reader, says as early as 1925: " You should demand that the writer take pains over the presentation, because his ideas come to you through the eye and not through the ear. Therefore typographical sculpture, through its visual quality, should do what the speaker's voice does for his thoughts.

##Closure
> Here the designer must intervene, he must in a sense aim at a larger whole; he must not continue to carry out the single task so mush as create structures from which single solutions can be derived.
> This adds to the work of design a new dimension of planning, form the angle of both language and type.
